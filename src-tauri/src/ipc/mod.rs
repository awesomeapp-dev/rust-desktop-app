//! `ipc` module and sub-modules are all Rust constructs necessary for the WebView to Rust Tauri IPC calls.
//!
//! At a high level it follows the "JSON-RPC 2.0" format
//!   - method_name - Will be the Tauri command function name)
//!   - params - Tauri commands will have one params argument by designed, called params (and state arguments)
//!   - response - Will be a IpcResponse with the JSON-RPC 2.0 result/error format back.
//!
//! The benefits of following the JSON-RPC 2.0 style is that it is simple, clean, and allows to wire the frontend to a
//! JSON-RPC 2.0 cloud backend easily.
//!
//! Notes:
//!   - This module re-exports the appropriate sub-module constructs as their hierarchy is irrelevant to callers.
